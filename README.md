# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews (Classification)

## Project Concept
The goal of this project is to build and deploy a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model capable of classifying the sentiment of IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative. By leveraging classification techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to analyze large volumes of text data, extracting meaningful insights regarding audience sentiment toward various films. Using models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors, this project explores different feature extraction methods, including Bag of Words and TF-IDF, to identify the most effective approach for sentiment classification.

## Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the growing importance of sentiment analysis in understanding consumer opinions and trends. With user-generated content, such as movie reviews, becoming an influential source of feedback, sentiment analysis can help companies, filmmakers, and marketing teams make data-driven decisions. By automating the process of sentiment classification, this project not only demonstrates the potential of machine learning in sentiment analysis but also provides an efficient method for processing large datasets.

## Project Applications
1. **Film Industry**: Studios and production companies can use sentiment analysis to gauge audience reactions to new releases, marketing campaigns, or specific actors and genres.
2. **Content Recommendation Systems**: Streaming platforms can integrate sentiment analysis to tailor recommendations based on viewers' opinions and preferences.
3. **Market Research**: Sentiment data from movie reviews can be valuable for understanding consumer behavior, assisting marketers in crafting targeted campaigns.
4. **Customer Service**: Sentiment analysis can be extended to customer feedback across various domains, offering actionable insights for improving products and services.

## Project Deliverables
1. **Preprocessing Pipeline**: A robust data preprocessing pipeline utilizing NLP libraries like NLTK for cleaning and preparing the text data, ensuring quality input for model training.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Evaluation of feature extraction methods, including Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) and TF-IDF (TfidfVectorizer), to compare their effectiveness in capturing sentiment-based features.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, were trained and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a focus on selecting the best-performing model for deployment.
4. **Deployment**: The final model is deployed on a web application interface, allowing users to input text data and receive real-time sentiment predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP and machine learning in extracting and analyzing sentiment from large text datasets. Among the tested models, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes provided the most balanced and reliable results, achieving high accuracy across both training and test datasets. With further refinement, the model can serve as a valuable tool for analyzing sentiment trends in user-generated content across various industries.
